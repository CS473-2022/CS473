syllabus:
  - heading: Objective
    content: "The goal of this course is for the students to develop an understanding of how to secure networks. The students will develop an appreciation of what security vulnerabilities exist in each and every component of the Internet, ranging from software to protocols to implementations of cryptographic algorithms, and how these vulnerabilities can and have been exploited in the real-world. They will learn how cryptography serves a fundamental role in secure communications on the Internet, as well as the defenses for various threats, as they have evolved over the years."

  - heading: Harrasment Policy
    content: "SBASSE, LUMS and particularly this class, is a harassment free zone. There is absolutely zero tolerance for any behavior that is intended or has the expected result of making anyone uncomfortable and negatively impacts the class environment, or any individual’s ability to work to the best of their potential. In case a differently-abled student requires accommodations for fully participating in the course, students are advised to contact the instructor so that they can be facilitated accordingly.<br>
    If you think that you may be a victim of harassment, or if you have observed any harassment occurring in the purview of this class, please reach out and speak to me. If you are a victim, I strongly encourage you to reach out to the Office of Accessibility and Inclusion at <u>oai@lums.edu.pk</u> or the sexual harassment inquiry committee at <u>harassment@lums.edu.pk.</u> for any queries, clarifications, or advice. You may choose to file an informal or a formal complaint to put an end of offending behavior. You can find more details regarding the LUMS sexual harassment policy here. To file a complaint, please write to <u>harassment@lums.edu.pk.</u>. <br>
    In addition to LUMS resources, SSE’s Council on Belonging and Equity (CBE) is committed to devising ways to provide a safe, inclusive and respectful learning environment for students, faculty and staff.
